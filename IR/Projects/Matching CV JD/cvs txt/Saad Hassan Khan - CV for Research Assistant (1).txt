My final year project is based up on the one of the most important issues in Punjab .It is  
basically  related  to  the  Software  development  and  Data  collection.  Our  Project  was  
funded by government of Punjab. In this project we develop a mobile App which can not

not  be  available.  Data  was  not  only  store  in  the  mobile  phone  but  also  in  a  backup  
database at our home server.
