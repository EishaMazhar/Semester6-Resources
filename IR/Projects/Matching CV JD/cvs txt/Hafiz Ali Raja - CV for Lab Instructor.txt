      Degree Project: “ Livewire Based Interactive Volumetric Segmentation ” using MATLAB  

Detail: Segmentation in medical image analysis is very important part. In segmentation  

there  are  some  simple  steps  are  involved  who  helps  the  doctors  and  medical  expert  to  

detect  the  exact  location  and  area  of  the  disease.  Our  research  is  related  to  the  livewire  

based interactive segmentation. This segmentation is using the livewire technique but also  

involving the human interaction for the best accuracy. In this research we first implement

the livewire on 2D images which is taken from the 3D Brain volume. Here we prefer to use  

the semi-automatic technique in segmentation.
