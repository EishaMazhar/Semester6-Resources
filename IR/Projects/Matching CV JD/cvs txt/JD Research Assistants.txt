Research Assistants/Associates are Academic Student Employees (ASEs) hired by faculty to assist in carrying out a particular research agenda. The payroll title for such employees varies from Research Assistant, Research Associate 1 and Research Associate 2. The title/pay level is determined based upon the ASE’s current academic status.

While a research assistant is expected to contribute in many ways to the research project, typical responsibilities include the following:

    Conduct literature reviews
    Collect and analyze data
    Prepare materials for submission to granting agencies and foundations
    Prepare materials for UW Human Subjects Committee review
    Prepare interview questions
    Recruit and/or interview subjects
    Maintain accurate records of interviews, safeguarding the confidentiality of subjects, as necessary
    Summarize interviews
    Provide ready access to all experimental data for the faculty researcher and/or supervisor
    Request or acquire equipment or supplies necessary for the project
    Manage and respond to project related email
    Prepare, maintain, and update website materials
    Supervise undergraduate students working on the research project (maintaining records on assignment completion, acting as liaison/mediator between the undergraduate students and the faculty researcher)
    Attend project meetings
    Attend area seminars and other meetings as necessary
    Summarize project results
    Prepare progress reports for the PI and funding agency
    Prepare other articles, reports, and presentations
    Monitor the project budget

Other duties and responsibilities may be assigned by individual researchers. Quarterly work requirements and schedules must be discussed with the Supervisor to ensure that the work priorities can be accomplished in the 220 work hours scheduled for the quarter (for a normal half-time appointment). Concerns about any additional responsibilities should be discussed first with the supervisor (faculty researcher), and then the Graduate Program Committee Chair or the Department Chair.
