Also, Netflix was not in the least bit unclear about why they won't ever offer offline playback- they designed a system initially to cater to streaming, and adding download capabilities to their users would require an entire ground-up redesign of their internal system, which would cost millions of dollars. Then, after costing so much, it would drop their overall profit per customer greatly for various reasons, while not actually providing any significant boost in customers.  

Amazon, on the other hand, designed their system with offline playback in mind, so it was not really an ""added feature"" so much as an ""activated feature"" for them. The infrastructure was there to begin with.  

TL;DR: Neflix implementing offline playback would be one of the worst business decisions in recent history because it would cost millions up front and reduce profits permanently all for a single feature that only a handful of people care about.",falcon4287,1441140824,t5_2qh6e,t3_3j85l3,t3_3j85l3,0,cunfgqs,television

525,"Well to be fair though they *do* charge for a hell of a lot of shows and movies, even for those on Prime. A lot are free but they are usually the older ones. Virtually all of the new seasons and film releases carry a cost. You can expect to pay around $30 for a single new season of a show, or $10 or more to watch a new movie. If you wait 8-12 months the price *might* come down but not always.

Plus they took a lot of their ""free shipping"" items and made them so-called ""Add On"" items, where you don't get free shipping unless you include them in an order that goes over $25. What royally pisses me off about that is that the other day I tried to buy a $5 ""add on"" item that I needed and I was not even allowed to buy it *and pay shipping* -- it literally blocked me from ordering it at all unless I had $25 worth of stuff already in the cart.

Don't get me wrong, Prime is awesome, but it's a bit less awesome IMO than it used to be with them cutting down the shipping benefit like that. Plus I'm grumpy about the idea of paying for TV or films *as a Prime member*.",doc_samson,1441155823,t5_2qh6e,t3_3j85l3,t1_cunh95g,1,cunngie,television

&gt;It's not a ""silly workaround"" to have internet access everywhere you go. This is where we are headed, and it's not some time of band-aid. It's not ""working around"" a problem.

I have Internet access. It's called a cellular phone. Netflix and YouTube and virtually other streaming app works fine with it. Amazon Instant doesn't. 

So yes. Having to bring a tablet along or preload a movie that I might want to watch during what might be downtime is a very silly workaround. You can say it isn't but that doesn't make it any less true. 


&gt;The silly workaround is offline playback. There will be no need for offline playback when there is essentially no offline.

Ok. Tell me all about something you obviously don't know anything about. Prior to today the workaround was done through tethering to trick the app into thinking you are on wifi and not data.

They also refuse to support Chromecast because they want you to buy their Fire stick which is admittedly good but it should be an option not a requirement to stream video content to your TV. I end up having to mirror my screen using the official Chromecast app on my Galaxy S6 just to watch their show Catastrophe on my Chromecast. 

And the to top it all off the Instant Video App, yes that's what it's called in my app tray, is crap. When you run it, it takes you via browser to Amazon.com  where all of the free prime videos are mixed in with the pay content. It should only show videos for Prime Instant Video but it doesn't.

I'm not going to buy n+1 services just to get one show - and really it's the shows I want. I couldn't care less about whether it's netflix, amazon or diddlytwat streaming services, it's the shows that I want to watch.

Content makers are going to have to sell their stuff on all of these platforms if they want to get to their audience.

At the moment we share a netflix account, but I would like to see fear the Walking dead - which in the UK is exclusive to BT, and maybe the alternative Top Gear, which is exclusive to Amazon.

I'm not going to pay for 3 services. Especially not on top of a broadband/cable TV package.

The most logical solution for audience members is to torrent the shows that aren't shown on whichever streaming service they pay for. At which point a feature like 'offline viewing for some of our content but not all' is not really a feature at all, it's just a ridiculous thing to have stopped you doing in the first place only to add back as though it's an innovation.

So really, the service that wins will be the service that gets the content without seeking out ""exclusives"" - cf steam. Thinking about ways of screwing the audience for a show unless they pay you just makes your service suck. Right now netflix et al are just trying to make their services suck in a desperate attempt to gain market share from their rivals at the expense of their customers who really just want a good value streaming service that has ALL the shows they want to watch.",[deleted],1441197646,t5_2qh6e,t3_3j85l3,t1_cunmmev,1,cuo2ahi,television
