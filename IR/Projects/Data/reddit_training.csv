They both ended at the same place, but everything surrounding the scene, the buildup, the conversations purveying the motivations of the  instigators were very poor, and they went for an absolute cliche with you know who.

Furthermore, I thought the Benjen tease and Kit's acting was average, when I consider him to be a good actor.

Finally, I think the direction was completely uninspired.  The showrunners clearly struggle to storyboard the more intimate/plain death scenes, namely this scene, the other big S5 finale death, and the crossbow death in the S4 finale.

&gt;Hip-hop artist and CEO of Empire Entertainment, Lucious Lyon, has always ruled unchallenged, but a medical diagnosis predicts he will be incapacitated in three years, which prompts the sharks to circle. Without further damaging his family, he must decide which of his three sons will take over. His favorite, young Hakeem, is a gifted musician but values fame over hard work. Middle son, Jamal, is talented and shy but gay -- embarrassing to Lyon. The oldest, Andre, is business-minded but lacks charisma. The reappearance of Cookie, his ex-wife, complicates things; she says he owes her for taking the fall for the drug-running that financed his early career.

&gt;Don't try to go viral

&gt;There's something insufferable about this desire to go viral.

&gt;It's no longer just about the hour these guys are on the air but also about how parts of the show will play on Facebook and Twitter to people who didn't tune in. These made-for-social-media skits feel more like they are for the morning after, rather than for the show.

&gt;I get it: It's hard to lure eyeballs to late night when there are so many other things to watch, and DVRs and Netflix make late-night viewing irrelevant. Going viral allows hosts to build their brands for those who would never think about turning to a network come 11:35 p.m.

&gt;As charming as Corden is, his rampant desire to go viral smacks of inauthenticity, and makes me not want to tune in.

&gt;The same can go for Fallon: I care less about The Tonight Show when I can see the best bits on YouTube the next day.

&gt;What I'm asking for is a show so vital it won't be enough to see just the highlights. And, yes, that's easier to write about than it is to execute.

1367,"&gt;Stephen Colbert **reportedely** took a pay cut to leave Comedy Central for The Late Show

CBS paying less than Comedy Central? Granted, he was one of the biggest stars on the channel, at or near the same level as Jon Stewart and Matt Stone and Trey Parker, but Comedy Central's budget must be absolutely dwarfed by CBS's. This is really difficult to believe. According to figures I can find online—so copious salt—Stephen Colbert was making about $6 million a year on CC. Letterman, before he retired, was in the $20 million a year range on CBS. I'm sure Colbert isn't going to be paid what Letterman was making, but a 70% cut in compensation for the hosting job is massive, particularly given that Colbert is already a proven late night host.

Here is the reality:

&gt;[ Fallon's rating in the 18-34 catgory is six times what ""Late Show with David Letterman"" receives on Channel 4 and Fallon's 18-49 rating is almost twice that of Letterman. It isn't as if Letterman is doing that badly in demographics as he approaches the end of his run before Stephen Colbert takes over in search of younger demographics. Letterman's ratings in the age 18-49 category grew about 45 percent here from a year ago and he almost doubled his 25-54 rating.](http://talkintv.buffalonews.com/2014/06/30/fallons-tonight-show-is-big-demographic-winner-here/)

Conan wanted the Tonight Show badly but I have a hard time believing that he wanted to water down his humor the way he had to in order to try to fit into the box of that prime slot.  I think Conan wanted that job but I think he would have liked to have done it a different way, with more sketches, and I bet they wouldn't let him do that (gotta have all the celebrities on to pitch their movies, 'cuz that pays the bills).

Then you take someone like Bill Burr or Louie CK -- maybe they wish they could make their comedy work on a show like that or maybe they can't imagine going into work everyday like that.  But there are lots of sacrifices.  It's not for everybody and I that's not the same thing as saying that not everybody would be good at it.  I think Bill Burr or Louie CK could do a show I'd love, but middle America would hate it.

None of this is to knock Stephen.  He naturally has a way about him that is edgy while appealing to middle America too.  He'll do that show as good as anyone has done it.

What his pay is in relation to you or me is irrelevant to the question of whether or not it's a pay cut.  If someone *is* earning less than they *were* earning, it's a pay cut.

I recognize it's probably a strategic move, and once he's proven his mettle his pay will surely increase.  There's also what's probably the real motivation: proving that Stephen Colbert can be a successful comedian without being trapped in the Conservative Pundit character.

Apart from that, what's the Late Show got to offer that the Colbert Report didn't?  A slightly bigger audience?  A much bigger set?  Meh.

1938,"I said he wanted the show badly. It's the first words I said.  The rest of my comment is my opinion, which is that wanting the show badly doesn't mean he wanted to do the watering down that he had to do in order to get it and try to keep it.

Did you religiously watch Conan O'Brien's show when he was on at the later time slot?  Because I did and I saw that his show was heavily fueled by sketches with supporting players who would come on and do really great bits.  That was the show he developed when he had the freedom to do what he wanted to do.  And so my point -- my opinion and my guess -- is that he would have liked to do the Tonight Show with a different tone and a different type of structure.  But being on the Tonight Show time slot significantly constrains any comedian into doing what will appeal to middle America.  I do think Conan wanted to be the guy who could do that but it's a tension between being himself and being what middle America and the bosses and shareholders at NBC want him to do at that time slot.  They want him to be #1 and to do that is not always great for the quality of the comedy.

I also understand that Louie CK said he'd like to do a late night talk show.  I also know that he doesn't do it because he'd have to change his comedy for the show.  I mean Louie CK -- do you realize that he gets paid relatively shitty for his TV show in exchange for having total autonomy, total creative freedom to make whatever he wants?

&gt;Hell an entire episode of Louie was him training to he a Late Show host. He even started working out for it (which if you've seen the show you know that means he REALLY wanted it).

You do realize that this is a fictitious version of his life, right?

He literally makes the show and sends it to FX and they put it on the air as is.  His contract says that they can't change it (of course, there are basic restrictions on things like nudity that he adheres to, but otherwise he literally does whatever he wants).  He could make A LOT more money if he would agree to do a show on network television where he would have to accept editorial input from other people, whether that would be producers, network executives, or whoever.

So I would ask you, why doesn't he do a more lucrative TV show on network television, not necessarily a talk show but a show sort of like his (or sort of like his old show Lucky Louie)?  A sitcom format basically but with his own version of it, but on network television where they insist on .  Why do you think he doesn't do that kind of show?

I would be surprised if he said something along the lines of ""I want to do a talk show and I'd be willing to do whatever they want in order to make that happen.""  My guess is that he'd say something like ""I'd love to do one of those shows, but I'm not sure I'd fit into the format"" or ""I'm not sure I'd want to sacrifice the artistic freedom.""

Why does everything have to be either/or?  Why do you think he either has to totally want to do a talk show or totally not want to do it?  Same with Conan?  Because this is how you are presenting your argument: they totally want to do it, and this means they absolutely have no reservations about making the necessary adjustments to fit into that format.""

1953,"Did anyone else notice that he cut Jeb off just as he was about to say something potentially newsworthy, twice? In my mind, the job of the interviewer is to make the interview into news, while the interviewee tries to achieve the opposite. 

If Howard Stern had had Jeb Bush there, especially with the stuff about his mother's comments, it would have been national news. Jeb was about to say something incredibly quotable about his mother, but Colbert had a bit he had to get to. 

So yeah, this is the first time I've seen him do a real interview, and it didn't go well, in my opinion. Like with Clooney, and every guest he had on the Colbert Report, he made himself and his jokes the central feature.  This was the point of the Colbert Report, but this format demands something different, something Letterman, who I thought was overly condescending, had in spades. Howard Stern is the undisputed master. Jon Stewart has it more than Colbert. It's like some kind of disarming hypnotism that Colbert just lacks somehow, or doesn't want to employ.  I hope he finds it within himself, or these interviews will continue to be pretty boring.

Before people start booing, I am Colbert's biggest fan, I watched every episode of Colbert, none of y'all did that besides me, I'm pretty sure.  I like the standup scene, but unlike a lot of people, I don't hold Colbert's improv background against him. This is just a sober criticism. Colbert is good at making fun of his guests, but not good at making them make fun of themselves, at least so far.

1804,"Well, with The Report, he had to keep up with pretty much all of the news *and then* write good, satirical material about that news with his staff. I think, with The Report, the bar was set very high in terms of good criticism/satire. The amount of knowledge and continued research he and his staff needed to do in order to make the show intelligent and relevant seems much higher than the format of a Late Show. And those intelligent skits took up 85% of the show. He only interviewed people for a very short amount of time.

If you think about any of the late shows on television now, 60-70% of the time is spent with two guests promoting anything from a film to a presidency. And the format before those interviews are topical, but not on the same level as The Report. Not to mention, they always end the show with a band or comedian. So the question becomes, how much of any Late Show is original content? Jimmy Fallon spends a quarter of his show lip singing with his guests, which takes almost no preparation in comparison with The Report.

I'm not entirely aware of Colbert's planned format for his late show, and I would like to state that I think it will still be A LOT of work, but I think this show will not demand as much research.",Young_Man_Tyhrow_Awa,1441878879,t5_2qh6e,t3_3k69yy,t1_cuvuiwm,1,cuwlf2s,television,no

2183,"Just watched Z Nation season 1 on Netflix. The first couple episodes weren't all that great but it really picks up fast and does a good job with pacing and telling personal stories/episode arc/season arc throughout the show which is a lot more than I can say for some other shows. 

It's still Sci-Fi and Asylum which means some of the effects aren't great but also it's not *that* bad. Hell, I'd say it's about up to par with some of The Walking Deads CGI.. 


Speaking of.. I think it IS better than The Walking Dead. Is it as dramatic? No but it tells a story that still has that tension at times and more important than anything.. It's fun and honestly well written. It doesn't ram terrible characters down your throats for 3 seasons and has some really good self contained episodes. 

Seriously power through if you don't like the first couple episodes. It feels like as it went on they realized the show was pretty good and took it more seriously. 


Also.. 

So.. I don't watch a lot of reality shows but I just watched the Finale of Home Free. I don't know HOW they financed that show, being able to give 8 brand new homes away but man was it good.

Moffat has some great one-off episodes: ""The Girl in the Fireplace"", ""Blink"", ""Silence in the Library"", ""Time Heist"".

He also has some terrible episodes: ""Let's kill Hitler"", ""The Snowmen"", ""The Bells of Saint John"".

He is really good at creeping me out, and making me squirm in my seat. That type of episode is great for one or two in a season, but ***every other episode*** starts to get repetitive.

2021,"I've started watching **Person of Interest**, after it's been recommended quite a lot lately.  
I really didn't like the way the show started and kind of had to fight my way through the first few episodes, but I was expecting that. After powering through The Good Wife, I learned that it can be worth it to watch some weak episodes early in the show, in order to be rewarded by great writing later on.   
Now that I'm halfway through the first season, I'm warming up to it and I can see the potential. The characters start out pretty bland, but you're starting to learn more about their backgrounds as the show goes on, which really makes a difference. Some overarching plotlines are starting to pop up and I heard that they're gonna focus more on that in the upcoming seasons, so that's good.

I finished Netflix' **Bloodline** last week and I highly recommend it. The pilot reminded me of the experience I had with The Shield, where I was thinking ""yeah, well, this is kind of cool"" throughout, but then the ending took me entirely by surprise and I just *had* to see where this was going.  
They employ a kind of unusual storytelling device by using flash-forwards, which worked really well in my opinion. You know what everything will lead up to after the first episode, but you have no idea *how* it's going to happen. It's a fantastic technique to draw the viewer in, if it's used correctly.  
It's character-driven drama, supported by a great cast. If I had to compare it to something, I'd say it's kind of similar to Six Feet Under, but without the procedural elements and a good deal darker. Really well done.",a4187021,1441979497,t5_2qh6e,t3_3k912m,t3_3k912m,8,cuxw7ls,television,no

But as you are starting to see, once they start fleshing out the story more and more, and actually focusing on the story arc, it gets really good really quickly. And season 2 and on are a lot more about the story arcs.

Based on what you said you like about Gravity falls, I'd recommend Steven Universe. SU has a family focus, subtle world building &amp; pretty art. Like Gravity Falls, SU starts with a heavy kid-orientation (the premise of the show is that half-human/half-gem Steven learns to use his magical powers with the help of 3 ""magical girl"" gems), but it has more substance than the average kids show. It squeezes in fight sequences, goofy humor, intimate moments of character development, clues about the gem's lore, a few legitimately creepy/chilling sequences, &amp; the occasional catchy original song into an 11-minute time slot. It is sweet, but not saccharine; it has a good message, but it is not preachy. While it is kid-friendly, the show centers around a functional non-traditional family unit, is overtly LGBT positive, &amp; it has a more diverse cast than most TV shows (adult/live action included). While I recognize it is not for everyone, Steven Universe is currently my favorite show on TV &amp; I heartily recommend it.",ewokoala,1442084149,t5_2qh6e,t3_3k912m,t1_cuw692k,2,cuz869e,television,no

2099,"I also started binge watching POI since last week. Currently mid season 3. Viewers *will* struggle with season 1. It was too episodic and comprised of a lot of one-offs and fillers. They were some interesting backstory slipped in some of them atleast and they do help build up to a more rewarding main plot later on. At this point, the *real story* kinda felt like a gimmick for the whole vigalante thingy to be honest.

It was only around mid season 2 that the *bigger picture* finally started unfolding. They were still some skippable episodes though but they were also some powerful and intense ones too. Carter really hit home for me a lot of times this season. The season finale finally kickstarted the main plot for me. It had me pumped and asking a lot questions. I started loving the show then.

Season 3 seemed slow at first but its doing really well now. The show has interesting characters (and a few precious side characters too hint hint Zoey and Leon). I still have a thing or two against some of the acting though like Jim Caviezel's wooden-badass-guy acting.

The show is based on an interesting plot device and concept that feels believable to our day and age. Its got good cast members and decent acting in general. Its average in some episodes but the good writing amps up in some. I would highly recommend the show to people but I wouldn't be surprised if some couldn't stand the slow season 1.

2301,"Do the characters get better ? 
I watched the whole first season and I was never planning on watching the second season but I read a lot of comments about how good S2 was.

My gripes with the first season were :
1) The universe and setting of the show are under-developed. There are a few scenes here and there (like the flashback when clarke's family is watching a old recording of a football match with their friends) that do but it's too little. The world lacks substance and isn't fleshed out enough. In a science fiction show, it's a really big problem imo.

2) The main characters are underwhelming. Clarke is so devoid of personality and charisma that I can't understand why people seem to think she's a good leader. Maybe because she's the only character in the entire roster that has half a brain. Bellamy is interesting, because despite his broody, handsome, twenty y-o archetype, he is often shown to be not much of a thinker. Which is refreshing. My personal favorite is Kane, I like the actor and like the character. I just feel his ""redemption arc"" was resolved too fast. I can't care about the rest of the characters, which is a problem.

3) So far the plot was very streamlined and the twists predictable (the very moment they mention Mount Weather, you know what one of the twists will be)

Is any of these getting better in S2?

Well, you can't fairly judge the entire show since you only saw three episodes.

&gt;I have not yet seen what I would call a redeeming feature about it yet.

In the entire three episodes you've watched? Sure, I'd buy that. General consensus, though, is it gets better after episode 4/5 and hits its stride in the second half of season 1 and continuing into season 2.

&gt;Hell, they defeated the water creature and saved their friend in the first episode by...splashing?

I don't remember the specifics of this scene in the pilot, but I imagine it was a lot of noise and whatnot.  Question, how do people usually scare off bears and other animals?

2312,"See, I don't get this attitude.  It's good for you that you're finding enjoyment in this show but why should anyone force themselves to sit through something that bores them until it gets good (and that's if it even gets good by my reckoning)?  Three episodes is more than enough for a network show to establish if there's anything worth pursuing in my opinion.  In that time The 100 has failed to invest me in any of the characters (if they can even be called that).  All the show has given in that timeframe has given us is a dull retread of Lost.

There are other things I can be doing than wasting hours of my life 'hoping' a show gets good.  Other shows to try, games to play, etc.  There's too much entertainment in the world for me to sample to devote my time to something that thus far hasn't earned my respect.

2316,"Oh FFS, did you seriously just try the ""don't complain about it if you don't like it"" argument.  Guess what, contrarian opinions are a part of discussions.  It'd be like me telling you any opinion you have to offer me about the show is invalid because you're a devoted fan and are too colored by bias.  

Discussion threads aren't created for one singular opinion - they're a forum for everyone to express an opinion whether you agree with it or not.  And my point about giving up after three episodes is this, a TV show has to present a hook to keep you tuning in week after week.  In the first three episodes this show doesn't offer a hook to keep me watching.  A new TV show needs this or else it can't hope to survive.

And you also can't argue ""It's practically 100% agreed that the first 4 episodes are terrible, and the rest of the show is good."".  This is only agreed upon by yourself and those that agree with you, it's circular reasoning.  You're only sounding out opinions that reinforce your own and everyone else should just shut up not say anything.

It's this simple, I gave the show a shot, thought it sucked, and have every right to share that opinion in relation to topical discussions regardless of whether you agree with me or not.  This reductive reasoning people try to use is ridiculous and counterproductive in general.  Shutting up when you don't like something doesn't improve your position, or the quality of things you wish to take an interest in.

Not that it's a plot-heavy show but it is character heavy. Try doing this with The Wire and you won't know what the hell is going on or what anyone is talking about. 

You can't watch two scenes of a movie and expect to get even half of what the movie has to offer and the way TV series are now, don't expect to it either.  Or read a chapter of a book and expect to get everything. Everything now is heavily serialized. If you can't spend time watching 7 seasons of a show, there are shorter shows out there to watch. Go watch Season 1 of Fargo or True Detective. Or go watch the miniseries Show Me a Hero which is only 6 episodes.

I understand it's daunting to see 7 seasons of a show and wonder how you'll ever finish, but you really need to understand that shows like Mad Men, and frankly most of the best shows these days, are not designed to be watched sporadically.  

You mention in other posts you don't have time to watch 7 seasons of a show.  Sure you do.  No one is saying you need to binge 80+ episodes in a week.  Watch 1 episode per week.  Watch 1 every two weeks.  The show is on Netflix.  It's my going anywhere.

I know someone right now who IS binging the hell out of the show, and while I'm glad they're watching it, I feel like they're missing a lot of the subtleties that you can really only get by reflecting on what you're seeing a bit.

Like how [Pat Buchanan said BLT instead of WMD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwEd_tcKBfU) because of him. 

The only way to deal with this properly is to refuse the interview altogether, or have fun with it, but that would mean figuring out Ali was a character acting stupid before the cameras start rolling, which none of the ones we ended up seeing on TV did. Who knows how many failed interviews they had to cut out.

Of course dedicated fan communities online are almost always going to figure it out, but people who don't go read about the show and just enjoy watching it week to week or even talking about it with a select group of people will still get to enjoy the reveal at the end.

One example is that I really enjoy watching Survivor, but I don't go to the Survivor subreddit while the show is airing.  There are people on there who are quite good at figuring out early on who the final few contestants are going to be, or even coming up with a good idea of who is going to win.  They do this by poring over the details of each episode, how it's edited, how the contestants are portrayed, and compare that with what the contestants are saying on social media and what they see in behind-the-scenes stuff online.  I can see how that would be fun in and of itself, but personally I just like watching the show and going along for the ride, so I just avoid all of that.

When filming they always film a bigger picture than they plan to end up with. However, this can pose some problems for remastering, like takes being approved for release that have something undesirable, be it a mic boom or another camera or whatever, around the edge of the master film. For the original release it doesn't matter, it gets cut out of the frame, but for the remaster it might, meaning that they'll have to digitally remove/add things which can cost a lot of money which can be a reason that it's never re-released in widescreen.

It's interesting to note, a LOT of old movies are re-released in widescreen HD, because it's actually captured on film and the original 480p release is no where near the quality of the master film.

In fact, *many* people, both critics and ordinary people, agree on this point.

Can I just point something out really quickly?

In its five seasons, the show *never* won an Emmy in any category. In fact, it was only ever nominated *twice.*

Personally, I really struggle to see why. I'm not persuaded by the ""competition"" argument (for example, did you know that both *Forrest Gump* and *The Shawshank Redemption* came out in the same year? Sucks, but only one can win a Best Picture Oscar.) -- There were 5 seasons, and every single one had at least one Emmy-worthy episode. I'm also unimpressed by the ""critical lag"" argument -- isn't the entire point of having a critical establishment to see greatness before it is widely recognized?

I'm absolutely not the kind of person to ordinarily go around saying things like this, but it's just what I feel deep down: If *The Wire* hadn't had ""too many"" Black main characters, *or* if it had been set in ""gritty"" pre-1990 NYC (or Philadelphia, or D.C., or really anywhere other than Baltimore) it would have crushed the Emmys. 

The awards just couldn't handle the idea of a show that put black people *qua* people at its center rather than as interesting ""flavor"" at the periphery, and couldn't wrap their minds around the concept that important, interesting, and dramatic things are still important, interesting, and dramatic even if they don't happen in New York or cities that are trendier or more ""up-and-coming"" than Baltimore.",CockroachBallerinas,1443293988,t5_2qh6e,t3_3menzc,t1_cvej5f4,26,cvf1ecg,television,no

3356,"The Sopranos is an awesome show there is no denying it and of course one of the all time best. It was also a first of its kind which puts it at a top spot just because it is genre defining.

However there have been cop shows forever. What The Wire did was to redefine the genre. The Wire was the first to show a realistic image of the police dept. AND life on the streets.  People who have lived those lives will tell you just how legit it is in its depiction of how people got by and dealt with gang life, growing up in extreme poverty and a inner city war zone. The show took something that many people were unable to understand and put them right in that world. It made you care for the kids thrust into gang life due to lack of other viable choices or just out right stupidity. 

The show provided a glimpse inside a police dept, political structure and media in such a way that made it much easier to understand the underlying problems and not just the ones the media decided to show to get shock value and ratings.

I agree the Sopranos is a great show but The Wire is something really special and should be required watching for anyone who wants to truly understand inner city life and the problems faced by those living there, the community and police force.",insanelyphat,1443301159,t5_2qh6e,t3_3menzc,t1_cvezf3n,6,cvf593x,television,no

Basically, this war is still being fought because the individual institutions that *could* change something are actually profiting from it. Politicians gain votes by being tough on drugs, police departements get more funding, lawyers specialize on defending drug criminals, and dealers couldn't have these high profit margins if they had to operate within a controlled legal framework. That's not even touching the topic of dirty money exchanging hands.

That's not the full picture, of course, but it's definitely not true that the show merely tells us that the war on drugs is wrong, but doesn't dig into the mechanisms that keep it going.",a4187021,1443302078,t5_2qh6e,t3_3menzc,t1_cveuyl4,3,cvf5r56,television,no

My only response is that this falls into ""critical-lag"" category.

It's absolutely correct that it takes a while to get into *The Wire* -- and that explains why it didn't initially gain traction among ordinary viewers.

...But there are human beings who are paid money to be critics. These humans have two jobs: (1) Point out why widely-acclaimed shows are not really that good; and (2) Point out little-known shows that actually deserve attention.

With *The Wire,* the critics were asleep at the wheel; ""It's great as a series, but is initially difficult on an episode-to-episode basis"" is a great explanation for an average viewer; for a critic, it's no excuse.",CockroachBallerinas,1443322318,t5_2qh6e,t3_3menzc,t1_cvfbrt5,7,cvffs9q,television,no

There's good reason as well, many stories, characters and the entire police system is based on the show's creator's time at the Baltimore Sun.

&gt;Simon has stated that he originally set out to create a police drama loosely based on the experiences of his writing partner Ed Burns, a former homicide detective.

What was Treme really about? The musicians making costumes and preparing for Mardi Gras? The one laywer looking for that kid that probably got shot by the Police? The woman chef rediscovering her love for N'orleans? The pennyless musician trying to put a band back together? Or how the dyckes where mismanaged during the storm? Did anyone really know? I doubt it, I think they just threw everything at the wall and then stuck with the storylines that interested them the most and pretty much abandoned the rest.

It was interesting and relatable.  The parallel settings did a good job of reconnecting an adult, jaded viewer to the tropes and fantasies of classic fairy tales.

Sadly, the second season just tossed modesty aside and tried to focus fully on plotting and intrigue.  The cast just could not support it.  There wasn't enough depth to any of the characters for the obnoxious story lines to be worth caring about.  All of the things that made Disney tales endearing were discarded for a watered-down imitation of mature drama.

Plus, I don't think we've even begun to see how he'll treat the extras of the show, like remotes, repeat segments, etc.

What I do think the show is lacking is a sidekick kind of character. Jon Batiste is cool, but I think he and Colbert will always be as uncomfortable as they look right now, and Colbert will inevitably need another character to ""play with"" on the show.

Dave, meanwhile, had Paul, all of his stagehands, his producer, people in the neighborhood (i.e. Rupert Jee), etc. that he could do improv with.

Right now, Stephen isn't improvising much, at least not as much as I think he should. That'll come, though, as others gain more of a presence on the show just by being there.

That seems flawed. For one, the President can instantly make it more difficult to pass such bills with a veto. Even simply threatening a veto makes it more difficult to pass legislation. Those words alone wield immense power, much less actually exercising the veto.  

A sitting President's administration also wields immense control over the allocation of campaign resources, not to mention additional bargaining chips which come into play during legislative negotiations and fundraising capabilities on behalf of favored polticians. At the time NAFTA was signed in December 1993, Bill Clinton was also closing out his first year as a newly-elected Pres. with an approval rating over 50%.

Check her out on Community if you haven't already. She was perfect for the latest season. ",RootsBoots,1443639235,t5_2qh6e,t3_3mz1vk,t3_3mz1vk,38,cvjllzj,television,no

In fact I was just watching *Grandfathered* last night, and I thought, ""This is a pretty good show, but who's gonna believe Paget Brewster is the mother of a 26-year-old?  She'd have to be in her late 40s or something!  Ha ha!""  Oops.  ",johnjonah,1443639493,t5_2qh6e,t3_3mz1vk,t3_3mz1vk,29,cvjlsmh,television,no

3766,"I don't watch Criminal Minds but her comments got me thinking of NCIS where all the males have been consistently been in all the seasons but the females have come in and gone.

The only one who has been on each season is Pauley Perrette.

3776,Oh yeah! I'd completely forgotten about her. I guess I didn't think about her being her replacement because she didn't stick around much longer than Brewster. I really enjoyed Tripplehorn too.

I don't think she ""ruined Community"" but I definitely didn't care for her character, and that was really disappointing because I was actually really excited to see that she was on the show. She played her role aptly, but it just felt badly written (as did much of season 6 to be honest).

She really needs to be featured in more things. What I'd give to see her in a made-for-TV version of TAH as Sadie Doyle.",caninehere,1443649135,t5_2qh6e,t3_3mz1vk,t1_cvjpmqx,1,cvjsj8t,television,no
